    <h1>Program Cost and Financial Support</h1>
    <body>
      <p class="summary">
Sophomore College has a $750 all-inclusive program fee, which may be reduced by half or waived entirely for eligible students. Stanford is committed to providing rising sophomores the opportunity to participate in Sophomore College, regardless of financial circumstances.</p>

<h2>SoCo Program Fee</h2>
<h3>
Finances for Sophomore College work very differently than during the academic year.</h3>
<p>Sophomore College assesses an all-inclusive program fee, which covers tuition, room and board, books, and transport and tickets for organized class activities.  All courses have the same fee, whether they are on-campus courses or travel courses. For courses with travel, travel with the class and off-campus meals during program dates are covered by the program fee.

The official program fee for Sophomore College is $1400. This amount appears on student invoices; however, through the generosity of Stanford donors, all SoCo students automatically receive an $650 scholarship, reducing the maximum student charge to $750. This $750 payment may be further reduced for eligible students as described below.</p>

<h2>Financial Support</h2>
<h3>Over 40% of SoCo participants typically receive support with the program fee.</h3>

<div class="bodylist">
<ul>

<li>All students will be automatically considered for financial support with the program fee unless students choose to opt out by emailing sophcollege@stanford.edu. Financial need will have absolutely no impact on selection of students for a seminar.</li>
<li>The Financial Aid Office determines, based on need, whether students may be eligible to receive a half-waiver of $375, or a full waiver covering the full $750 program fee.</li>
<li>Financial support awards will be visible in the application system by the time admission decisions are released. Applicants can review their award amount before committing to participate, by accessing their application at <a href="vcasc.stanford.edu">vcasc.stanford.edu</a>.</li>
<li>SoCo financial support is directly applied to the student account after the program fee is billed and counts only against the program fee.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Costs Not Covered by Program Fee</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
As during the regular academic year, students are responsible for the cost of travel to campus, or to the designated meeting location for seminars originating off-campus. Students are responsible for summer storage costs.</li>
<li>Phone and network activation fees, course materials other than the supplied books, and personal expenses are also student responsibilities. While all course-required group trips and meals are covered, incidentals such as optional excursions, clothing and tolietries, and souvenirs from field trips would be considered personal expenses.</li>
<li>Although the SoCo program fee covers the cost of room and board during the SoCo program dates, students would be responsible for paying any fees related to lockouts or lost keys, damages, and unauthorized guests in your room.</li>
</ul>
<p>A limited number of courses may require costs that are not included in the program fee. If Financial Aid recommends that you receive assistance with the program fee and you are accepted to one of those courses, then we will also invite you to request financial assistance with those costs. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><span id="title">Learning Theater</span> begins in Ashland--for some students, it will be more expensive to travel to Ashland than to Stanford, and we will assist with the difference.</li>
<li><span id="title">In the Age of the Anthropocene</span> begins in Sitka, Alaska, and also requires special waterproof and hiking gear.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have financial concerns, please be sure to contact us and we will see if we can suggest some options. Email <a href="mailto:sophcollege@stanford.edu">sophcollege@stanford.edu</a> or contact the associate director Dayo Mitchell directly.</p>

<h2>Understanding Your Bill</h2>
<h3>The Program Fee</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Because SoCo courses are considered summer courses, the $1,400 program fee will be included on your June 20 bill.</li>
<li>After you receive your bill, the Financial Aid Office will adjust your student account to accurately reflect the $650 scholarship deduction that all students receive, plus any individual student financial support awarded (half-waiver: $375 or full waiver: $750). These credits will be applied to your account before the July 15 bill due date. If you pay the bill early, please deduct the expected credits.</li>
<li>Please email <a href="mailto:sophcollege@stanford.edu">sophcollege@stanford.edu</a> if it appears the scholarship has not been applied properly, by around July 7.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Early Arrival Housing Fees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your university bill in August will show charges for early arrival housing fees--DON'T WORRY, you are NOT responsible for paying these.</li>
<li>SoCo covers Early Arrival charges, and your account will receive a credit for the charges in early September.  The credit will appear in your account as “anticipated aid”.  “Anticipated Aid” is considered “paid” so please IGNORE the due date of September 15 for this portion of your bill. You ARE still responsible for paying any other items on your bill by the September 15 due date.</li>
<li>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:sophcollege@stanford.edu">sophcollege@stanford.edu</a> if the “Anticipated Aid” does not appear on your official bill by September 8.</li>
